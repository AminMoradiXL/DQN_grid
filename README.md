*** DCSIMSEP should be installed first to simulate the power grid parts!

The environment used in this works is a customized version of DCSIMSEP - a DC load flow simulator of cascading (separation) in power systems developed primarily by Paul Hines, at the University of Vermont, with contributions from Eduardo Cotilla-Sanchez, Pooya Rezaei, and Maggie Eppstein.
